Coderun is a platform for enthusiastic coders to learn, practice and execute code in more than 10 popular languages right in their browser without the need of installing different IDEs for different languages.

This project mainly targets two communities : 

1. University students who take regular coding lab sessions. 
2. Enthusiastic coders/Beginners from all over the world who want to learn how to code.

Teacher can upload tutorials from the different topics and via admin panel. Users/Students will be able to access those resources and learn. Once they clear their theoritical concepts, they can go ahead and practice some questions given by the teacher as assignment.

Student will be able to code, save, download and print their code right in their browser without installing even a single software.
